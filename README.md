Arduino ESP866 as a Wifi link for other projects
I am inspired by https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link
but I wanted to make it configurable for applications and types of networks.
and not to limit to asynchronus serial.
This could allow mobile devices to access radio networks like AX25 packet radio or NRF24L01.
Not always serial.
